SimpleAuthorization
===================

* Install
* Unless "roles" table already exists or do not want:
  * script/generate simple_authorization --migration Role
  * rake db:migrate
* User.has_many(:roles)
* Include SimpleAuthorization::ModelMethods::User in User


Example
=======

#No roles:
class AdminController < ApplicationController

private

  #Authorize is where authorization happens. Override to define
  #what that means for a particular controller. The default implementation
  #is to check whether current_user has the roles required by the
  #controller/action, and nothing will happen if no roles are required
  def authorize
    redirect_to login_url unless current_user.admin?
  end

end

#Using the built-in role system
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController

  require_roles :admin, :only => [:destroy]
  require_roles :editor, :only => [:new, :edit, :create, :update]

end
